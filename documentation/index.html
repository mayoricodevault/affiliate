		<h1>Documentation</h1>

			Most of your questions regarding the style/look of Affiliate Pro can be answered by referring to the twitter boostrap documenation
			at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>. Read below for information regarding Affiliate Installation, Integration, Features and Specifics.</p>

	<p>Affiliate Pro requires the following in order to operate.  If you don't have any of these contact your hosting provider and they can usually activate it on your account</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<p>Installation is very easy, just follow these steps and you'll be up and running on your server in no time!  Installation is very simliar to most php/mysql applications.  
		Upload, add database, and configure the config file.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Step 1. Unzip downloaded file</li>
			<li>Step 2. Upload contents of "upload" folder to your server</li>
			<li>Step 3. Create a mysql user and database (recommend using mysql wizard in cpanel)</li>
			<li>Step 4. Using a program like phpmyadmin import the included affiliatepro.sql file into your new database</li>
			<li>Step 5. Open config.inc.php located in the "auth" folder</li>
			<li>Step 6. Add in your database username, password and database name</li>
			<li>Step 7. In the same file edit the line "$INSTALL_FOLDER = 'affiliate-pro';" ONLY if you've gotten tricky on us and changed the folder name.  If in root leave it empty.</li>
			<li>Step 8. If necessary upload your modified config.inc.php file back to your server to save your changes</li>
			<li>Step 9. Visit http://yourdomain.com/affiliate-pro and login with default account or create a new one (you will need to use default account initially to assign a new admin user).</li>
			<p>
				That's it, you should be up and running!

	<h2>Website Integration</h2>
	<p>
		Integration into current php websites is very simple to do.  Integration instructions are also included when you login under "Integration and Settings"
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Step 1.</b> - Include php tracking file on any page you wish to track (ie, home page)
		<code><pre>include('affiliate-pro/controller/affiliate-tracking.php');</pre></code>
		* File located in affiliate-pro/controller/affiliate-tracking by default.</li>
		<br>
		
		<li><b>Step 2.</b> Once a sale has been completed (for example a thank you page) include the file to record the sale into Affiliate Pro.
		<code><pre>$sale_amount = '21.98';<br>$product = 'My Product Description';<br>include('affiliate-pro/controller/record-sale.php);</pre></code>
		* File located in affiliate-pro/controller/record-sale by default</li>
		<br>
		
		<li><b>Step 2b. (Alternative)</b> Use the included PayPal IPN <b>(controller/paypal-ipn.php)</b> sample file instead for additional sale confirmation security through PayPal Service.  You will most likely need to create a custom PayPal form and include a custom input to pass the affiliate ID.
		<code><pre>&lt;input type="hidden" name="custom" value="&lt;?php echo $_COOKIE['ap_ref_tracking'];?&gt;"&gt;</pre></code>
		</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Recurring Commissions</h2>
	<p>
		To make a commission recurring add the two commission lines to your standard integration (step 2) from above
	</p>
	<ul>
		<strong>Recurring commissions are initialized the same way fixed commissions are with the addition of the two recurring variables below: </strong>
		<code><pre>$sale_amount = '21.98';<br>$product = 'My Product Description';<br><strong>$recurring = 'monthly';</strong> //can be daily, weekly, biweekly, or monthly<br><strong>$recurring_fee = '10';</strong> //percentage of original sale<br>include('affiliate-pro/controller/record-sale.php);</pre></code>
		<strong>Important: Recurring commissions requires you to setup the following cron job to work.</strong>
		<code><pre>0  1  *  *  *  /usr/bin/php -q /home/username/public_html/affiliate-pro/data/recurring.php</pre></code>

	</ul>
	
	<h2>
		WooCommerce Specific Integration
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Step 1.</b> - Include php tracking file in <b>wp-content/themes/THEMENAME/header.php</b> (best to use full path)
		<code><pre>include('/home/myusername/public_html/affiliate-pro/auth/affiliate-tracking.php');</pre></code></li>
		<br>
		
		<li><b>Step 2.</b> - Find this line in <b>wp-content/plugins/templates/checkout/thankyou.php</b> (should be line 63)
		<code><pre>&#60;?php do_action( 'woocommerce_thankyou', $order->id );?></pre></code>
		After it add this:
		<code><pre>&#60;?php $sale_amount = $order->get_total(); <br> $product = 'WC Order #: '.$order->id; <br> include('/home/myusername/public_html/affiliate-pro/auth/record-sale.php');?></pre></code>

		<code><pre>unset($this->session->data['shipping_method']);</pre></code>
		Right <b>before</b> add this:
